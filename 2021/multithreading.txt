------------MultiThreading---------

1. Multitasking : achieve multiple task at same time called
   Ex: at same time CPU running browser as well as vlc as well as microsoft doc
   so i this case vlc is a process - video , music , time all are thread
   
   we can achieve the multitasking using two ways
   1. Multi processing
   2. MultiThreading

2. Multi Processing:
   When one system is connected to multiple processor in order to comelete the task.
   
   vlc

  ---------------
     OS
  ----------------
  |      |      |
 CPU    CPU    CPU
 
 it is uitable for system or OS label.
 
3. MultiThreading: executing multiple thread at same time (sub process or small task).
   mostly used in games ,animationa and software
   
4. Diff btw process and thread
       process                                                thread
  heavy weight                                         lightweight
  contex switching takes more time                     less time
  communication takes more time						   less time
  each process has diff addresss space                 same
  process are not dependent on each other			   are dependent on each other	   
  
5. life cycle
  
  new                              runnable                               running                                dead/terminated
 (when thread is created)     thread goes into this state         thread goes into this state                   when task is completed
							  when will call t.start() method    when JVM allocate the processor(run method)
							  
							  
6. Two ways to create the the using thread class and runnable interface.
   best way is runnable interface.
   
7. how many things we can achieve using thread 
   1 one task one thread
   2 one task multiple thread
   3 multiple task one thread  -- this is not possbile
   4 multiple task multiple thread
							  
							  
8.Thread class constructor
  Thread()
  Thread(runnable target)
  Thread(String name)
  Thread(runnable target,string name)
  
  Thread(threadGroup tg,runnable target)
  Thread(threadGroup tg,String name)
  Thread(threadGroup tg,runnable target,String name)
  Thread(threadGroup tg,runnable target,String name,StackSize)
  
9. Methods
   basic method - run(),start(),currentThread, isAlive
   naming method - getName(),setName()   
   daemon thread -  isDaemon ,setDaemon(boolean b)
   priority - getPriorty(),setPriority()
   preventing thread - sleep(),yield() , join()
   
   wait notify notifyAll methods from object class
