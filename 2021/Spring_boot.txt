1.Spring                                     Spring Boot
  is framework	                              its module
  Complex in terms of configuration           less complex

2. Use of spring boot application
  - Stand alone spring boot application
  - Aims at rapid development
  - It provides following things
    1 Auto dependency
	2 embeded http server tomcat and jetty based on configuration
	3 spring boot cli
	4 cloud service
	5 management endpoint
	
3. Advantages
  - Provide auto configuration for quick start of application
  - create stand alone application
  - comes up with embeded http server to avoid usages of war file
  - it reduce the development effort and simplify the maven configuration
  - consist wide range of api monitoring managing application in dev and prod
  - integerates with spring eco-system like spring jdbc , spring orm , spring data , spring security and avoid the boilerplate code
  
4. Feature
  - Spring CLI
  - Spring Dependencey
  - Spring initializer
  - Auto configuration
  - Spring Actuator
  - Logging and Security
  
5. Ways to create the application
  - CLI
  - Initializer
  - Spring Maven project
  
6. Possible source of exernal configuration
  - Applciation properties
  - Command line properties
  - Profile specific properties
  
7.What is spring boot starter ans some common starter
  - Starter is set of convenient dependencies managemet. Starter makes development rapid and easy.
  - all comes in org.springframework.boot group
  some common starter
  
  1 spring-boot-starter
  2 spring-boot-starter-jdbc
  3 spring-boot-starter-web
  4 spring-boot-starter-jpa
  5 spring-boot-starter-security
  6 spring-boot-starter-aop
  7 spring-boot-starter-test
  
8. Spring actuator
 - using this feature we can see whats heppening inside the running application.
 - wee can easily debug and the application at running time.
 
9. Dependencey Management : Is used to manage the dependencies and configuration automatically 
   without specifing the version of any that dependency.
 
10. Miminum Requiremt of spring boot application
  - Java 8+
  - Spring Framework 5.19 +
  - Maven 3.3 +
  - Tomcat 9 
  - Sevlet Version 4.0 +

11. Spring dev tools is set of tools aims to make development easier. if application running in prod it automatically disabled.

12. Where we mention the databse properties
    : in application.properties
     spring.datasource.username
	 spring.datasource.password

13. Main class of spring boot application
   - public class 
   - @SpringBootApplication annotation
   - main method
   
    @SpringBootApplication
	public class Test(){
		public static void main(String args[]){
		  SpringApplication.run(Test.class,args);
		}
	}
	
14.how to enable http2 support in spring boot
   - server.http2.enabled = true
   
15. Diff btw @RequestMapping and @RestController
   - @RestController = @controller + @ResponseBody
   
16. JPA :  Java Persistence API
   - JPA is used to reduce the boilerplate code.
   - Hibernate : is an implementation of JPA offer a loose coupling.

17. Diff btw @SpringBootApplication and @EnableAutoConfiguration
   - @SpringBootApplication is combination of @Configuration @ComponentScan and @EnableAutoConfiguration
   - @EnableAutoConfiguration :: Enable auto-configuration of the Spring Application Context, attempting to guess and configure beans that you are likely to   need. Auto-configuration classes are usually applied based on your classpath and what beans you have defined. For example, if you have tomcat-embedded.
18. how to deply spring boot application as jar or war.
  - 
  
19. Best way to expose custom application configuration with sppring boot
   using @Value annotation
   
20. how will remove and override the tomact server
  - we will exclued the tomact server using tag <exclusion> in web dependency
  
21. how to disable embeded web application or disable default webe server
  - spring.main.web-application-type = none
  
22. how to disable particular class for auto configuration.
	- using @EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude={Test.class})
	
23. @RestController : convert the response into xml or json so api read that. beacause its combination of @controller and @ResponseBody annotation.

24. How to use profile in spring boot
    - in application.properties mention spring.profile.active = prod
	and create different properties file name as application-prod.properties , application-dev.properties
	
25. Spring actuatot and its use
    -means moving or controlling
	-spring boot actuator provide additional feature that help you to monitor and manage application when you pushed into prod
     it includes additional feature like auditing , health it generate automatically.
    - we can enable feature using dependencies 
	<dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
    </dependency>	
  
   url for actuator : http://localhost:8081/actuator , http://localhost:8081/actuator/health will get server status using this, http://localhost:8081/info 
   some end point we can explecetly added into application which through we can get beans , env details server details and all.
