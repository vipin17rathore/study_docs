1.How we can achieve the thread safety.
  using synchronization
  using volatile keyword
  using final keyword
  using atomic variable
  
2. copyonWriteArrayList clss : synchronized list

3. how to remove duplicate element from list   
   using linkedhasset
   stream.distinct method

4.how to compare two arraylist first sort it using Collections class than use .equals method

5.removeAll
  retainAll

6.how to iterate the hashmap
  using iterator
  using foreach loop
  using lambda foreach method

  method put,remove   
  
7 how to compare two hashmap
  using .equals method
  or using .equals with keySet()
  
8 internal working of hashmap 
   uses hashing hashcode()
   default bucket size is 16
   buckect contains 16 node each node contians key value , hash and maintain the next pointer also 
   each node behave like a linkedList
   
9 fast performance 
  concureentHashMap inernally divide into 16 segmant 
  lock occur only on when we perform the write operation not for reading
  Segment locking occur 
  null key and null values are not allowed
  concurrentHashMap never throw concureentHashMap modification exception but we can get that in synchronizedMap 	 	
  
10 what is the diff btw internal working of hashMap and linkedHashMap
   internally hashmap works on linkedlist concept but linkedhashmap works on dubblyLinkedlist concept 
   in this each node connect to its previous and next index as well.
   
11 how put works in hashmap : on hashing principle
12 what will happen if multithread application will use the hasmap
   data mighht be currupted becase so many thread will try to update the value at same time
