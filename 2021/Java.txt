Java

---DataType---
 8 type of data type avaliable in java
 boolen
 byte 
 char 
 short
 int 
 long
 float
 double
 
Wrapper Class
overflow and underflow

Diff ways to create object 
--By new keyword
--By newInstance() method
--By clone() method

Anonymous object :::
Anonymous simply means nameless. An object which has no reference is known as an anonymous object. It can be used at the time of object creation only.

 Java abs() method
 ------
1) Wrapper class
 --convert primitive into object and object into primitive :
 auto boxing and unboxing
 
	  auto boxing
	  int num = 10; // int primitive
      Integer obj = Integer.valueOf(num); // creating a wrapper class object
      System.out.println(num + " " + obj);
 
	  unboxing
	  
	  Integer obj = new Integer(10); // Creating Wrapper class object
      int num = obj.intValue(); // Converting the wrapper object to primitive datatype
      System.out.println(num + " " + obj);
	  
2. Singleton class is a class whose only one instance can be created at any given time, in one JVM. 
  A class can be made singleton by making its constructor private.
  In terms of practical use Singleton patterns are used in logging, caches, thread pools, configuration settings, device driver objects.
  
  public class SingltonClass {
	
	private static SingltonClass singlton = null;

	private SingltonClass(){
		
	}
	
	public static SingltonClass getInstance() {
		if(singlton==null) {
			singlton = new SingltonClass();
		}
		return singlton; 
	} 
	
	public String getMessage() {
		return "Singlton Class";
	}

Jdava doesnâ€™t use pointers because they are unsafe and increases the complexity of the program. Since, Java is known for its simplicity of code

4. A Marker interface can be defined as the interface having no data member and member functions. In simpler terms, an empty interface is called the Marker interface. The most common examples of Marker interface in Java are Serializable, Cloneable etc. The marker interface can be declared as follows.

public interface Serializable{
}

Use: 
Marker interface is used as a tag to inform a message to the Java compiler so that it can add special behaviour to the class implementing it.
